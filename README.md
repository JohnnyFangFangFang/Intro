**Hello World**

Feel free to check out my temporary [personal page](https://johnnyfang18.wixsite.com/my-site). A new one will be established in the near future. The page serves as a portal to my social media, CV, and side project portfolio. For your convenience, my CV and other links are listed below as well.

I just finished a web development course from an online bootcamp. Through this 9-month journey, I built my knowledge upon front-end development. Currently, I am looking for a front-end engineer position, and I believe I am a good fit to the role due to some points, including but not limited to:  
- Rapid Self-Learning Ability
- Enthusiasm for Software and Continuous Engagement
- Leadership and Positive Impact on People


üöÄ **My Tech Stack**  
- Front-end: JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React, Tailwind, Sass / SCSS, Bootstrap, Integration with RESTful APIs, RWD
- Back-end: Firebase, Node.js / Express.js, MongoDB
- Others: Git, GitHub, Figma / FigJam, Trello, Discord, Notion
